          As an I.T. major student at the University of the West Indies, the workload can feel overwhelming at times. 
          Between balancing programming assignments, group projects, labs, and theory-heavy courses, it often feels like there aren’t enough 
          hours in the day. Each week brings new deadlines, and keeping up requires careful planning and strong time management.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes it even more challenging is that technology is always changing. Many of the courses demand not only that we learn core concepts, 
          but also that we practice applying them with the latest tools and frameworks. On top of that, exams require a deep understanding of theory, 
          while projects test our ability to be creative problem-solvers. It’s stressful, but it also pushes me to grow, adapt, and prepare for the realities of the tech industry.

        <h2 class="post-title">Having fun</h2>
        <p class="meta">September 26, 2025 by Sean Thompson</p>

        <p>
          Having fun at university is just as important as keeping up with assignments and exams. The workload can be stressful, and if you spend all your time buried in books, 
          burnout is almost guaranteed. Taking breaks to hang out with friends, join a club, or enjoy campus activities can help clear your mind and bring back your energy. 
          It’s during these moments of fun that you often build lasting memories and friendships that make the university experience special.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, it’s important to strike a balance. Fun should never come at the cost of your studies. Managing your time wisely allows you to enjoy social activities 
          without falling behind academically. In the end, university life is about more than just grades — it’s also about learning how to balance responsibility with enjoyment, 
          so you can leave not only with a degree but with experiences and lessons that last a lifetime.
